Welcome the documentation of YunionCloud.

## What is YunionCloud?

YunionCloud is an open-source unified multi-cloud/hybrid-cloud IaaS platform that provides unified APIs to access heterogenous IaaS resources across a broad range of cloud providers, including on-premise KVM/BareMetal/VMware, private clouds such as OpenStack, and public clouds such as AWS, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, etc. YunionCloud provides a set of APIs and a web UI dashboard. YunionCloud hides the differences of underlying IaaS resources, and makes it easy to build PaaS services and applications across multi-cloud/hybrid-cloud IaaS platforms.

Here are some highlights of YunionCloud:

- A self-contained light-weight private cloud that manages KVM hypervisor in scale

- A multi-cloud solution that is able to manage a wide range of major cloud providers, including private cloud, such as OpenStack, and public clouds, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud, etc.
- A full set of feature-rich APIs to access a wide range of the IaaS resources from platforms above with consistent resource models and APIs
- A multi-tenancy RBAC-enabled identity and access management system
- A multi-cloud image management system that automates image conversion between different cloud platforms
